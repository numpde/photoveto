Take charge of your image with PhotoVeto
===

PhotoVeto gives you control over how **images of yourself** are used and shared in the digital space.
It allows you to set and communicate your own terms, 
for example through QR codes attached to your clothes or the laptop lid.
These QR codes direct to a page outlining the image usage preferences, 
thereby promoting respect for personal image rights and privacy.

While PhotoVeto is not a flawless solution, 
it represents another step towards a more respectful and consent-aware digital environment. 
By using PhotoVeto, you're contributing to a broader movement 
that values personal choice and seeks to balance individual rights with the widespread nature of digital media. 
Be a change-maker and set a precedent for how we handle personal imagery in an interconnected world!
