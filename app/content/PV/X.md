<center>üö´ **Photography and Image Use Notice**</center>

As the owner/presenter of this QR code, I assert my right to digital privacy and security with a maximum-privacy approach. Accordingly, I make the following requests:

- **No Photographs:** I explicitly do not consent to be photographed or recorded in any visual form. This includes, but is not limited to, casual snapshots, commercial photography, and any other type of image or video recording.

- **No Image Usage:** If images or recordings of me exist, I do not consent to their use, distribution, or publication in any manner, whether for commercial purposes or otherwise.


<center>üåê **Why This Is Crucial**</center>
---

In an era where digital content can be replicated, altered, and shared with unprecedented ease, we face significant challenges:

- **Privacy Concerns:** Once an image is uploaded online, controlling its distribution and usage becomes virtually impossible, leading to potential privacy violations.

- **Security Risks:** Unauthorized photographs can be exploited for harmful purposes, including identity theft, cyberbullying, and various forms of harassment.

- **Indelible Digital Footprint:** Each uploaded image contributes to a digital footprint that is often permanent and beyond one's control.

Your respect for this request is vital. It signifies your commitment to upholding the values of digital rights and cyber security. Together, we can foster a digital ecosystem that is safe and respectful for all individuals.

<center>**Thank you** for your understanding and cooperation in championing these principles.</center>
