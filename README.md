# PhotoVeto

PhotoVeto is a platform for creating personalized digital licenses for photograph usage, linked to QR codes. 

Users can specify their preferred terms for photo usage, which are then encoded into a QR code.

When this code is scanned, it directs to a webpage displaying the user's custom license terms, 
clearly communicating their photo usage preferences.
